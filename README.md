# Smart_Irrigation_System_Using_AIML

project overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based decision support system for optimizing agricultural irrigation.
It predicts whether irrigation is required (ON/OFF) based on crop type, growth stage, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.

The system leverages a Random Forest Classifier and provides:
