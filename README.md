# Smart_Irrigation_System_Using_AIML

Project Description:

This project is a machine learning-based decision support system designed to optimize agricultural irrigation. It uses real-time crop and environmental data to predict whether irrigation is required, helping farmers save water, energy, and costs while increasing crop yield.

The system leverages a Random Forest Classifier trained on a dataset containing features like Crop Type, Crop Growth Days, Soil Moisture, Temperature, and Humidity. Based on these features, the model predicts whether irrigation should be turned ON or OFF.

A feature importance analysis is also included, providing insights into which environmental factors influence irrigation decisions the most. The results are visualized using a bar plot, making it easier for agronomists and farm managers to interpret and take action.

🔹 Key Features:

📂 Data Preprocessing: Cleans and encodes categorical and numerical variables.

🌱 Smart Prediction: Predicts irrigation needs (ON/OFF) based on environmental and crop data.

🔍 Feature Importance: Visualizes the importance of different parameters affecting irrigation.

📊 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy and classification reports to measure model performance.

🎨 Data Visualization: Seaborn-based feature importance charts for better interpretability.

🔹 Tech Stack:

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Dataset: Crop irrigation scheduling data
